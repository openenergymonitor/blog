The main board in development is emonDCduo, a dual-channel DC monitor, WiFi enabled, aimed at solar/battery systems. emonDC has been developed by Daniel Bates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;emonDC development kits are now available in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://shop.openenergymonitor.com/emondc/&quot;&gt;OpenEnergyMonitor Store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emonDC_system.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Example System Schematic&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;target-uses&quot;&gt;Target Uses&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;12V, 24V and 48V Solar PV systems, up to 64.4V max&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Battery monitoring.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Remote DC data-logging.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Documentation on the unit, and on DC monitoring theory, is contained at the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/danbates2/emonDC&quot;&gt;Github repo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;features&quot;&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Two-channel high side &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; DC current and voltage sensing, up to 64.4V or 75V, suitable for a wide range of extra low voltage generator/battery systems.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;50Amps onboard shunt rating or 1000A external shunt rating.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hall-effect current sensor footprint alternative for isolated current only measurement.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Waterproof, clear-top plastic case.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;128 x 32 OLED display.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WiFi Connectivity.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low-power mode (10mA draw).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Accurate 12-bit ADC.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Over-voltage and reverse voltage protected (fuses).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, it can function as an independent unit, self-powered using an onboard buck voltage converter powered from a measurement channel. Data can be stored locally to a MicroSD card, keeping time with an on-board RTC and coin-cell. RFM69 based radio transmission is possible through a RFM69Pi module. For accuracy, the voltage sensing resistors and other reference voltage resistors are through hole, for easier modification, ensuring the option of very high resolution at low voltages. The I2C ports can connect control boards for power management, GPIO expander modules, or can forward data to a charge controller module. Skipping wireless transmission altogether, a standard 6-pin UART header is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware-options&quot;&gt;Hardware Options&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;emonDCduo as designed here has shunt, termination, power-supply and other module options.
&lt;a href=&quot;https://vimeo.com/319164161&quot;&gt;See this demo video of the options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;selection-process&quot;&gt;Selection process&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To help users with their purchase, a few options are available at the shop page. A specification process is required to purchase a unit, based on the installation context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A recommended process would be something like:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Find the required Amperage of the target channels.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select shunt on shop page exceeding the maximum expected current.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select cable mounting, ring terminals require crimping, screw terminals are convenient.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Select power supply option. If the unit is powered from a measurement channel, then a DC-DC buck regulator is required. I the unit is powered from an external 5V PSU, then wires need connecting to a 5.08mm terminal block on board.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Check the remaining options on the store page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;firmware&quot;&gt;Firmware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The firmware is based on emonESP, and detailed instructions on compiling and uploading the firmware can be found in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP&quot;&gt;emonESP documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emoncms&quot;&gt;Emoncms&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last 10 months have seen a lot of emoncms development. Thank you to everyone who helped push things forward. @anna_carboncoop , @thib66, @cagabi, @borpin , @pb66, @paul. @CDuffy , @bruce_miranda , @Bill.Thomson&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some of the highlights include:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;JSON support in phpmqtt_input, by @borpin &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/pull/776&quot;&gt;#776&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emoncms/task&quot;&gt;Task module&lt;/a&gt; development &amp;amp; new input processors by @cagabi &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/pull/818&quot;&gt;#818&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ongoing localisation and translation work by @thib66&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Improved support for SQL feed engine @isfh-ohrdes &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/pull/805&quot;&gt;#805&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/emoncms/sync&quot;&gt;Sync module&lt;/a&gt; for easier data export from emoncms.org&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Email verification and account deletion feature&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Feature to trim or clear feed data, alongside deletion @emrys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A lot of bug fixing and interface improvements to inputs and feed list @emrys&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Device module development @Adminde&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Input process list refactor @emrys @TrystanLea&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;DB schema creation and update refactor @anna_carboncoop &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/pull/930&quot;&gt;#930&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Python based service runner @Greebo &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms/pull/1025&quot;&gt;#1025&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

  &lt;li&gt;Dashboard module improvements: anti-xss filter, dashboard html access, &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/portable-emoncms-dashboards-looking-for-testers/6870&quot;&gt;tag:name support&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Ongoing &lt;a href=&quot;http://github.com/emoncms/group&quot;&gt;groups module development&lt;/a&gt; @cagabi @anna_carboncoop&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A key goal outlined in the last planning update was to complete the integration of the device module developments into emoncms. The device-integration branches are now included in the latest version of emoncms and the device module. The new input and feed interfaces are accessible via a beta testing switch. Thanks to @Adminde for all of his work on the device module and @emrys for his help working through a long list of improvements to the input and feed list views.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emoncmsorg&quot;&gt;Emoncms.org&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thank you to everyone who has supported us and bought emoncms.org credit so far. Billing went live on the 1st of July, considerable work went into linking the shop to emoncms.org (thanks @gwil), the billing view and functionality for linking multiple accounts. We are currently working through the final steps of the billing implementation, primarily removing inactive accounts and disabling posting if the balance is negative for more than a month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition to billing, work has been done on bringing the emoncms.org and standard emoncms code base closer together. In particular the input processing code, a requirement for installing the device module and making the new input interface available on emoncms.org, which are both now live.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The support we have had through credit purchases has enabled us to welcome a new member to our team @emrys, who has been a great help on emoncms development since joining us in April.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Forum post: &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emoncms-org-billing/7187&quot;&gt;Emoncms.org billing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emonsd-image--hub-software-stack&quot;&gt;EmonSD Image &amp;amp; Hub software stack&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have recently released our latest emonSD image:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Latest Raspbian Stretch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;RaspberryPi 3B+ compatible&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Root file-system is now fully read-write (although low-write developments are maintained).&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;SSH disabled by default (push button or boot partition file enable)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Full details, release notes and download link can be found here: &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/new-emonsd-release-emonsd-30oct18-raspbian-stretch-pi3b-compatible/9005&quot;&gt;emonSD-30Oct18&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hardware--firmware&quot;&gt;Hardware &amp;amp; Firmware&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;@Robert.Wall released a complete rewrite of the &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx-3phase&quot;&gt;emontx 3phase firmware&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the year to use PLL.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Testing and development has been ongoing for EmonLibCM, thanks again to @Robert.Wall&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EmonTx v3.4.3 release, see &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/openenergymonitor/emontx3/blob/master/hardware/readme.md#v343&quot;&gt;change log&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Decision was made to postpone integration of heat pump monitor MBUS reader (which was listed on the February plan)  for inclusion in STM32 based future hardware development.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although not in the original plan we also made good initial progress on STM32 development this year following the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/openenergymonitor-9th-of-march-2018-meeting-summary/6847&quot;&gt;OpenEnergyMonitor March meetup&lt;/a&gt;. We plan on building on this in the coming year, more detail in the next post.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emonevse--demand-side-response&quot;&gt;EmonEVSE &amp;amp; Demand side response&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The EmonEVSE has now obtained OLEV approval for the EV charging station government grant in the UK, and we are working with several OLEV accredited installers who have completed successful installations around the county. We had a successful showcase of the EmonEVSE at &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/fully-charged-live-9-10th-june/7256&quot;&gt;Fully Charged Live Event&lt;/a&gt; earlier in the year. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://openenergymonitor.com/emonevse-wifi-connected-ev-charging-station-iec-60947-5-type-2/&quot;&gt;EmonEVSE is now available in our web store&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;EmonEVSE currently integrates with EmonPi to provide solar PV divert functionality and Emoncms data logging. Work is underway to integrate EmonEVSE with smart energy tariffs and to make scheduling of charging sessions at times of low carbon intensity easier. See &lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2018/11/demand-side-response/&quot;&gt;Demand Side Response Development&lt;/a&gt; blog post and forum posts on &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/emoncms-demand-shaper-module/9097&quot;&gt;demandshaper module&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/running-emonesp-on-the-sonoff-s20-smart-plug/9096&quot;&gt;EmonESP Sonoff S20 SmartPlug&lt;/a&gt; firmware.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Looking forward to pushing things further in the remainder of 2018 and into the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Demand side response (DSR) has been a OpenEnergyMonitor project interest for some time (e.g PV diversion) but has only made its way into a product more recently with our work on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://guide.openenergymonitor.org/applications/ev-charging/&quot;&gt;OpenEVSE charging station&lt;/a&gt;. The OpenEVSE already implements real-time DSR, this post outlines how we are working on improving on this by integrating the forecasting and scheduling approaches being developed as part of our involvement in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/cydynni-energylocal-community-hydro-smart-grid-blog-post/4762&quot;&gt;EnergyLocal project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;!--more--&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;DSR: Demand Side Response is the idea of moving demand to&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better match supply, something that becomes more important as we supply more of our electricity from renewable energy.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Reduce electricity system cost by reducing the maximum dispatchable generation, distribution and transmission grid capacity needed.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Household electricity demand such as lighting, computing, TV, cooking, fridge/freezer, washing have relatively low DSR potential, either due to the need for these demands to happen during times of occupancy (peak demand) or because these demands are relatively small.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However as we move towards a zero carbon future, most scenarios suggest that large scale electrification of transport and heat is needed, alongside powering up of renewable energy. Both electric vehicles and electric heating e.g heatpumps &amp;amp; hot water storage have significant DSR potential.&lt;/p&gt;

This screenshot from our work on modelling zero carbon energy systems based on The Centre for Alternative Technologies ZeroCarbonBritain model &lt;a href=&quot;https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/sustainable-energy/zcem/integrated.html#fullhousehold&quot;&gt;https://learn.openenergymonitor.org/sustainable-energy/zcem/integrated&lt;/a&gt; shows an example of the extent to which renewable energy supply could vary in the future and so the potential for DSR to move demand to better match supply.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;i&gt;Dark blue: traditional household electricity demand (minus any heating), Red: heatpump demand with DSR, Green: EV demand with DSR, Blue: Electrolysis demand for synthetic fuels soaking up large excess capacity, Total: Wind and solar output.&lt;/i&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;

Energy local are pioneering community energy aggregation tariffs with both time of use pricing and pricing based on availability of a local renewable energy generator. A household with loads suitable for DSR can lower their electricity cost and use a greater amount of local power by shifting their demand to better times.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
EnergyLocal provide a day ahead forecast that can be used to schedule appliances, EV’s, hot water storage etc.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;

For households not able to take part in community energy aggregation tariffs such as EnergyLocal, Octopus Energy have recently introduced a time of use tariff, that reflects wholesale electricity prices. &lt;a href=&quot;https://octopus.energy/agile&quot;&gt;https://octopus.energy/agile&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Agile also provide a day ahead price profile that can be used for scheduling.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Savings made by using these tariffs can help payback expenditure on smart energy technologies. Especially where battery or heat storage is considered during the build or retrofit stage. E.g using thermal mass to store heat from heatpumps during times of excess supply.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;a href=&quot;https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/images/gridcarbon.png&quot;&gt;
   &lt;img src=&quot;https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/images/gridcarbon.png&quot; style=&quot;width:276px&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;

Another approach to forecasting could be to use [grid carbon intensity](http://carbonintensity.org.uk/), weather forecasts e.g darksky API and grid demand forecasts (to avoid peak times).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Users keen to stay with their existing electricity suppliers e.g Ecotricity for Electric Highway EV charging benefits could still make use of scheduling to ensure demand happens at the best time from a carbon and limiting grid strain perspective.

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;control-approach&quot;&gt;Control approach&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;table&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;

&lt;p&gt;1. &lt;b&gt;Realtime&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The emonEVSE is our first product that implements automated DSR, designed to charge a connected electric vehicle according to the available output from a solar PV array, it is an example of automated real-time DSR. A similar application and control strategy is PV diversion to hot water.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2. &lt;b&gt;Combined real-time &amp;amp; later scheduled period&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A real-time only control strategy is limited in the case that solar output in a given day does not charge the car up sufficiently for use later in the afternoon/evening or next day, or the hot water tank is not heated sufficiently for an evening/morning shower. In both cases a further period of charging will be needed. This could be achieved with a basic second charging period e.g boost charge before use or an overnight charge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make both of these applications work well the control system needs to know when the user wishes to use the car or hot water and the state of charge or temperature target that needs to be reached.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;3. &lt;b&gt;Forecast based scheduling&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A limitation with the last approach where solar was not enough to complete the charge or heat the tank directly is that the boost charge may happen at a time that is more expensive, or higher carbon. It may be better to charge at a higher rate through the middle of the day, importing power from the grid at that time, than importing during the evening peak. Integrating a solar forecast for the day ahead could predict if the charge will complete directly from the solar and if not proportionally increase the charge rate for the day.&lt;/p&gt;
  
&lt;p&gt;Another limitation of real-time DSR for hot water heating is that on a sunny day, the cylinder can heat up too quickly and so will then sit at a high temperature loosing heat for longer than it needs too. It may also result in larger ramp effects and strain on the grid if storage is filled during the morning leaving everyone’s solar systems to export through the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Leaving an EV at a high state of charge for a long time is also meant to cause a higher rate of battery degradation and so control strategies that bring the charging period as close to the time of use as possible may be particularly important.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using a forecast and information on charge required could allow the control system to absorb power throughout the period of excess supply to better follow the supply curve, reducing ramp strain on the grid and reducing heat store loss and battery degradation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style=&quot;width:35%&quot;&gt;

It’s based on the ESP8266 IoT platform using MCP3208 12 bit ADCs to sample AC voltage and current.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoTaWatt can log data locally to on-board SD card and post directly to &lt;a href=&quot;https://emoncms.org&quot;&gt;Emoncms.org&lt;/a&gt; via WiFi.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IoTaWatt uses the WiFi enabled ESP8266 (ESP-12S) microprocessor. The ESP8266 is mounted using NodeMCU adaptor, the decision was made to use the NodeMCU form-factor to allow flexibility for customisation and future upgrades e.g ESP32.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The onboard SD card allows data to be saved locally with high resolution and network resilience. If the IoTaWatt is posting to an Emoncms server and loses network connectivity data logged to the SD card will be bulk uploaded to Emoncms when a network connection is restored.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An on-board real-time clock (RTC) ensure the time-stamp is always correct. The RTC is set using NTP. Using the IoTaWatt on a WiFi network with a reliable internet connection is highly recommended, however, the IoTaWatt can operate without an internet connection once the RTC has been initially set via NTP.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/iota-config.png&quot; alt=&quot;IoTaWatt&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IoTaWatt is configured via a web interface served directly from the IoTaWatt ESP8266. See &lt;a href=&quot;http://iotawatt.com&quot;&gt;IoTaWatt.com&lt;/a&gt; for a live demo of the interface.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The IoTaWatt supports automatic over the air (OTA) firmware updates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;security&quot;&gt;Security&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;IoTaWatt supports end-to-end encrypted connection to Emoncms using new &lt;a href=&quot;http://emoncms.org/site/api#input&quot;&gt;Emoncms API transport layer encryption&lt;/a&gt;. Due to the limited resources of the ESP8266 microcontroller HTTPS connection is not possible. However, Emoncms offers an in-built transport layer encryption solution where the emoncms apikey is used as the pre-shared key for encrypting the data with AES-128-CBC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Automatic OTA firmware updates ensure the IoTaWatt is always running the latest most secure version e.g a firmware update was released and automatically deployed to fix the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.krackattacks.com/&quot;&gt;KRACK WPA vulnerability&lt;/a&gt;. Firmware updates are digitally signed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;emontx-vs-iotawatt&quot;&gt;emonTx Vs. IoTaWatt&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I mentioned at the beginning of this post, there are no plans to discontinue the emonTx. The IoTaWatt is not designed to replace the emonTx, rather to complement it. Each unit has advantages in key areas:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;emontx-advantages&quot;&gt;emonTx Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Low power: battery power / single AC-AC adaptor&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;No setup required&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Supports Optical Pulse sensor (interrupt input) to interface directly with utility meters&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Approximate 3-phase with firmware update&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Multiple emonTx’s can communicate with a single emonPi / emonBase&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;WiFi connection not required&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;iotawatt-advantages&quot;&gt;IoTaWatt Advantages&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Large number of CT sensor inputs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Flexible configuration (many different types of CT’s supported)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;On-board SD card logging&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OTA firmware updates&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Direct posting via WiFi to Emoncms.org&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The obvious advantage of the IoTaWatt over the emonTx is the number of CT sensor inputs. Another key advantage is the flexibility of the IoTaWatt, each input channel (AC voltage &amp;amp; current) can be individually configured and calibrated. The IoTaWatt supports a number of different sizes of CT sensors with calibration presets for CT sensors e.g &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/20a-max-clip-on-current-sensor-ct/&quot;&gt;20A&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/100a-max-clip-on-current-sensor-ct/&quot;&gt;100A (standard)&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/200a-max-clip-on-current-sensor-ct/&quot;&gt;200A&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

The project is at the forefront of making it possible for households to source their electricity directly from local, community-owned renewable sources.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Bethesda pilot project, How it works&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first part of the CydYnni project started with about 80 households (with 20 more joining soon) and a single 100 kW hydro generator. Using smart meters suitable for half hourly billing in participating households and at the hydro generator, the amount of hydro power used by the community is calculated for every half hour. The hydro tariff is 7p / kWh for the power used each half hour by the community providing a significant saving for households. Any additional power required is bought from the supplier Co-operative Energy on a time-of-use tariff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The project provides cost savings to participating households, increased income for local renewable energy schemes and a more direct sense of having electricity provided from - in the case of the pilot project a hydro turbine just down the road!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a nice video here on the project which gives a good overview:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe width=&quot;100%&quot; height=&quot;315px&quot; src=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/embed/3z8GrTBLw8M&quot; frameborder=&quot;0&quot; allowfullscreen=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a number of organisations working on the project of which we are one small part:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;EnergyLocal: The organisation founded by Mary Gillie with the initial idea and in depth understanding of the energy market behind the project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;CydYnni: A local consortium of community energy projects and organisations including Ynni Ogwen and Partneriaeth Ogwen, Ynni Padarn Peris, Moelyci, Coetir Mynydd, Antur Waunfawr, Ynni Anafon and the National Trust.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Co-operative Energy: The Energy Supplier through which households participate in the project.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Epower also known as NFPAS: The non fossil fuel purchasing agency – handling aggregation, power sharing and the nuts and bolts of billing.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;1010: Graphic design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;OpenEnergyMonitor: web app development in part 1 and home hub (base-station) development in part 2.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s been great being involved in such a pioneering project run in the local community in which we live (the OpenEnergyMonitor office is about 5 miles from Bethesda).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our role so far has been to develop a web app / energy dashboard so that participants can see when the local hydro generator is running and how likely they are to be on the cheaper hydro tariff. Participants can see their own consumption as well as the aggregated consumption of all participants.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main energy dashboard app designed by 1010 and implemented by ourselves can be viewed online here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have also developed a dashboard that is more focused on exploring the full data history of the hydro generation and community consumption, this dashboard can be viewed online here:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From the start of January the hydro supplied 57% of the electricity consumption of the participating households. You can really see how the available hydro generation decays usually over about a week after a significant rain event and the extent of the oversupply when it is raining.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be interesting to model the addition of solar to see how periods of lower rainfall might be supplanted by solar generation and explore other options for supplying the unmatched demand - e.g. anaerobic digestion.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 1: Energy Dashboard / Web App development&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This first stage of the project relies on the app or looking at how rainy it is to signal to the households when it’s a good time to use energy. Any demand shifting is done manually by the householder. The data update rate from the smart meters is also relatively slow, with 48 half hourly readings updated daily but usually available in the app with a lag time of anywhere from 15 hours up to 63 hours over the weekend.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Part 2: Hub&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next stage of the project for us is to improve on this with an in home hub (based currently on the OpenEnergyMonitor emonbase), which will interface with a WIFI/radio meter gateway developed by Energy Assets, providing much faster 5-10s meter readings as well as enabling control of smart appliances, plugs and EV charging.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This development has driven some of our most recent improvements to the EmonPi/EmonBase, such as the recently launched WIFI Hotspot setup and ongoing development on the emoncms device module, which alongside auto-configuration of inputs and feeds provides the option to define control devices starting with the Sonoff S20 WIFI Socket, Martin’s WIFI Relay unit and the OpenEVSE charging station.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the coming months I will try to blog more on development progress and the technical implementation of the system in addition to insights into the data coming from the project demonstrating local community energy.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Trystan Lea</name></author><summary>Over the last year we have been involved in a project in our local area (Snowdonia, North Wales) called CydYnni – EnergyLocal. The project is at the forefront of making it possible for households to source their electricity directly from local, community-owned renewable sources.

The Bethesda pilot project, How it works

The first part of the CydYnni project started with about 80 households (with 20 more joining soon) and a single 100 kW hydro generator. Using smart meters suitable for half hourly billing in participating households and at the hydro generator, the amount of hydro power used by the community is calculated for every half hour. The hydro tariff is 7p / kWh for the power used each half hour by the community providing a significant saving for households. Any additional power required is bought from the supplier Co-operative Energy on a time-of-use tariff.

The project provides cost savings to participating households, increased income for local renewable energy schemes and a more direct sense of having electricity provided from - in the case of the pilot project a hydro turbine just down the road!

There is a nice video here on the project which gives a good overview:



There are a number of organisations working on the project of which we are one small part:


  EnergyLocal: The organisation founded by Mary Gillie with the initial idea and in depth understanding of the energy market behind the project.
  CydYnni: A local consortium of community energy projects and organisations including Ynni Ogwen and Partneriaeth Ogwen, Ynni Padarn Peris, Moelyci, Coetir Mynydd, Antur Waunfawr, Ynni Anafon and the National Trust.
  Co-operative Energy: The Energy Supplier through which households participate in the project.
  Epower also known as NFPAS: The non fossil fuel purchasing agency – handling aggregation, power sharing and the nuts and bolts of billing.
  1010: Graphic design
  OpenEnergyMonitor: web app development in part 1 and home hub (base-station) development in part 2.


It’s been great being involved in such a pioneering project run in the local community in which we live (the OpenEnergyMonitor office is about 5 miles from Bethesda).

Our role so far has been to develop a web app / energy dashboard so that participants can see when the local hydro generator is running and how likely they are to be on the cheaper hydro tariff. Participants can see their own consumption as well as the aggregated consumption of all participants.

The main energy dashboard app designed by 1010 and implemented by ourselves can be viewed online here:

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emonpi_wifi.png&quot; alt=&quot;emonpi wifi&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have just made significant progress in streamlining the setup process by enabling the emonPi / emonBase to broadcast a WiFi access-point (AP) on first boot then scan for local WiFi networks and allow the user to connect. The emonPi will then turn off it’s AP and connect to the local network. There is also an option to connect via Ethernet or stand-alone WiFi AP mode when no local network is available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/emonpi-network-wizard1.png&quot; alt=&quot;emonpi-network-wizard1&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The new Network Setup Wizard will be included on all new purchased in July 2017 onwards. Existing emonPi’s with a Raspberry Pi 3 can be updated by running Admin &amp;gt; emonPi update in Emoncms. The emonPi will only broadcast a WiFi AP if Ethernet is not connected and no WiFi setup is currently present.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trystan is also working on making the input-processing setup for new devices easier by adding device template support to the Emoncms Device module. More on this the come…&lt;a href=&quot;https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/development-devices-inputs-and-feeds-in-emoncms/4281&quot;&gt;see development forum thread&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
