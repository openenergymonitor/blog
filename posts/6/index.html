  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    This first example in the hourly energy modelling tool model's the hourly output of a given installed  capacity of wind, wave, tidal or solar. The model really isn’t doing  much its just loading the capacity factors for every hour from the 10  year dataset and multiplying the capacity factor by the installed  capacity.<br /><br />The total electricity generated is calculated as the sum of  the electricity generation in each hour and printed along with the  capacity factor at the end.<br /><br />This example is useful for just seeing what the <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/energymodel/#dataset">ZeroCarbonBritain renewable capacity factor dataset</a> looks like, you can zoom and pan through the datasets for onshore wind, offshore wind, tidal, wave and solar pv, click on the link below to open the tool:<br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T7q21zj15Vo/VXlOl1119MI/AAAAAAAASbc/3WNsO_O2ayo/s1600/variablesupply.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="454" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-T7q21zj15Vo/VXlOl1119MI/AAAAAAAASbc/3WNsO_O2ayo/s640/variablesupply.png" width="640" /></a></div>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br /><b>Online tool:</b> <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/energymodel">http://openenergymonitor.org/energymodel</a> &gt; navigate to <i>1. variable supply</i><br /><br />The units are really not important the example could just as  well be in MW's or GW's. kW's where chosen as the other model examples in the series are  focused around building a hourly model that's relatable to an average  households energy demand. The kW's of installed capacity could just  relate to a small share of a much larger wind turbine, solar farm, wave  or tidal power installation.<br /><br />Running the model for each of these generation types with the same installed capacity the results are as follows:<br /><br /><table class="table">    <tbody><tr>        <td></td>        <td style="width: 12%;">Onshore wind</td>        <td style="width: 12%;">Offshore wind</td>        <td style="width: 12%;">Wave</td>        <td style="width: 12%;">Tidal</td>        <td style="width: 12%;">Solar</td>    </tr><tr>        <td>Installed capacity</td>        <td>1.0kW</td><td>1.0kW</td><td>1.0kW</td><td>1.0kW</td><td>1.0kW</td>    </tr><tr>        <td>Annual generation</td>        <td>2834 kWh</td><td>4204 kWh</td><td>2482 kWh</td><td>2092 kWh</td><td>826 kWh</td>     </tr><tr>        <td>Capacity factor</td>        <td>32%</td><td>47%</td><td>28%</td><td>23%</td><td>9%</td>     </tr></tbody></table><br />In all of the examples above the installed capacity of the renewable generator was the same (1.0kW) but we can see straight away that there is a significant difference in the total electricity generated by each type. A unit of offshore wind generates just over 5 times as much energy as a unit of solar pv using the <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/energymodel/#dataset">zerocarbonbritain dataset</a>. By itself this is not enough information to evaluate the effectiveness of a technology, we would need to compare the costs per unit of installed capacity, embodied energy per unit of installed capacity, how well a particular solution matches demand, the land areas required, the availability of the resource to name just a few of the many factors that need to be weighed up but it does highlight one of the important factors.<br /><br /><b>Python example source code</b><br />Alongside the online javascript modelling tool there are a series of python versions of the examples which are simpler to follow as they dont include all the code to create the visual output, they just print out the main results at the end.<br /><br />The following 19 lines of python code are all you need to load the ZeroCarbonBritain dataset and run through all 87,648 hours, calculating the power output for each hour and accumulating the total energy supplied over the 10 year model period:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"># dataset index:<br /># 0:onshore wind, 1:offshore wind, 2:wave, 3:tidal, 4:solar, 5:traditional electricity<br />gen_type = 4<br /><br />installed_capacity = 1.0 # kW<br /><br /># Load dataset<br />with open("../dataset/tenyearsdata.csv") as f:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; content = f.readlines()<br />hours = len(content)<br /><br />print "Total hours in dataset: "+str(hours)+" hours"<br /><br />total_supply = 0<br /><br />for hour in range(0, hours):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; values = content[hour].split(",")<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; supply = float(values[gen_type]) * installed_capacity<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; total_supply += supply<br /><br />capacity_factor = total_supply / (installed_capacity*hours) * 100<br /><br />print "Installed capacity: %s kW" % installed_capacity<br />print "Total supply: %d kWh" % total_supply<br />print "Capacity factor: %0.2f%%" % capacity_factor</span><br /><br /><b>Next:</b> Variable supply and flat demand - investigating the degree of supply/demand matching

The tool models supply and demand on an hourly basis which is a significant improvement over simpler annual approach.<br /><br /><b>Understanding its workings</b><br />I had been wanting to dig down deeper into the workings of the model and unpick the effect of the different components, the full model has so many different things going on that its hard to see how each component such as space heating demand from heatpumps, space heating profiles, electric vehicle charging profiles, water heating, or different generation technologies affects the bigger picture of the overall supply/demand balance and resulting storage requirements and so over the last month and a half I've spent some time looking into this in more detail. <br /><br /><b>Python and javascript example models</b><br />I started by writing a series of python models that modelled many of the key components in turn using the full 10 year hourly dataset used in the ZeroCarbonBritain spreadsheet model, exploring the level of supply/demand matching for each generation technology. As I started to model some of the more complex demands such as space heating from heatpumps, including the effect of solar and internal gains, I needed to be able to see what was going on in more detail so I converted the models to javascript and wrote a data viewer using flot.<br /><br /><b>Online visual tool</b><br />I've put all these model examples together into an online tool and added alongside each model a brief analysis and extended results of the many model run's I ran with different parameters. The tool also includes an introduction and overview of the uk energy context which is intended to help put the model examples which focus on domestic traditional electricity demand, space heating and electric transport in context. This tool is now available online here:<br /><br /><br />Launch online zero carbon energy system example models: <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/energymodel">http://openenergymonitor.org/energymodel</a><br /><br />and its all open source with the code and full website on github here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/TrystanLea/zcem">https://github.com/TrystanLea/zcem</a><br /><br />The tool covers the following model examples and context pages:<br /><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Introduction<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Energy Overview<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1. Variable supply<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Variable supply and flat demand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3. Variable supply, traditional electricity demand and oversupply<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4. Mixed supply and flat demand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5. Variable supply and space heating demand<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6. Electric Vehicles<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7. All<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Aggregation<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZCB Dataset<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ZCB web model<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Python models <br /><br />I have found it really interesting doing this work, but it also feels like a chapter early on in a large book. There is a lot more I'd like to understand in more detail and expand on which I hope to continue with over time. <br /><br />

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    We've had quite a few people ask about the throughhole emontx v2 and  emonGLCD's designs since we've moved away from stocking them in the shop  and developed the pre assembled units. I've also had several  conversations with people offline who said how much they enjoyed  building the kits and encouraged us to keep supporting and stocking  them. The challenge is the complexity of running an online shop with  many different product lines and the additional workload of kiting and  stock ordering - but it seems like it might be worthwhile for us to look  into a way to make it possible.<br /> <br />The emontx v2 currently uses different 3.5mm jacks to the emontx v3  and emontx shield, It also required a different case which needed  milling to use. To try and standardise on the components required I've  been working on a new version that is designed to fit in the emonTH case  that doesn't require milling and uses the higher quality 3.5mm jacks  used on the emontx v3 and emontx shield.<br /> <br />As I got stuck in to the design I thought Id add the powering via AC  circuitry that's on the emontx v3 and find a way of ensuring all spare  IO is available + the addition of a row of terminal blocks with power,  ADC's and digital IO breakout in much the same style the EmonTH.<br /> <br />The first revision of this new design is now available on github here:<br /><a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/tree/master/emonTxV2.5" title="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/tree/master/emonTxV2.5">https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/tree/master/emonTxV2.5</a><br /> <br />and looks like this (im really quite pleased with how it turned out,  there's something quite satisfying about designing and routing together a  pcb, trying to find neat layouts and so on):<br /><br /> <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/board_0.png"><img alt="" src="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sites/default/files/board_0.png" style="height: 584px; width: 500px;" /></a><br /> <br />The main features are:<br /> <ul><li>2x CT sensor inputs using higher quality 3.5mm jacks used on the EmonTx v3 and emontx shield</li><li>1x ACAC Voltage sensing and power input</li><li>Terminal block power, ADC's and Digital IO breakout + full spare IO breakout.</li><li>Onboard DS18B20 footprint</li><li>Based around ATmega328 + RFM69 core</li><li>Fits in emonTH enclosure</li></ul>The main downside perhaps of this design is that in order to get it  into the emonTH case I needed to drop the number of CT inputs down from 3  to 2, the thinking being that most applications are house consumption +  solar pv. But Im aware that this does make is unsuitable for 3 phase  application, we do want to develop a dedicated 3 phase board design with  voltage sensing on each phase so perhaps that's the better option for 3  phase application than using the emontx.<br /> <br />I've sent off for a first prototype PCB from ragworm so will be  building and testing this design hopefully next week. Id welcome  thoughts on the design and any suggestions and may do another revision  before getting these made in quantity.<br /><br /> <strong>Common component kit</strong><br /><br /> The other idea we've had is that since the emonglcd and emontx kit  share so many of the same resistors and capacitors we could potentially  offer a general openenergymonitor throughhole component kit with enough  of the common components to build an emonglcd or several emontx kits.  Then alongside the common component kit would be the PCB and  emontx/emonglcd specific components such as the LCD, connectors and  perhaps the atmega. We're' just working out the pricing for this. This  could be quite a good option for people who have good home electronics  stocks of different resistors/capacitors and could simplify the kitting  for us with just one kit with 10x 20x of all the different resistors and  capacitors. Interested in hearing people's thoughts on the idea.<br /><br />This blog post is a repost from the forum thread here: http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/10802 <br />

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    On the 12th – 14th of June there is an event happening called Open Source Circular Economy Days in many cities around the world, including in London <a href="https://oscedays.org/london/">https://oscedays.org/london/ </a>which we will be attending. I first found out about the event from Lars Zimmerman who is on the core organising team and I met last year at OuiShare, Lars runs <a href="http://openitagency.eu/">http://openitagency.eu</a> encouraging and helping people incorporate open source in their businesses, organisations and projects. The aim of Open Source Circular Economy Days is to bring open source thinking to the circular economy. The energy associated with manufacturing is a large part of our overall energy consumption and the question of embodied energy especially in the zero carbon energy sector is particularly important to understand better. There is quite a bit of discussion at the moment about the level of energy return on energy invested EROI required from the zero carbon energy sector as a whole in order to sustain a certain level of technological society.<br /><br />My impression of trying to look into embodied energy and life cycle analysis is that it seems that the measurement of embodied energy and other impacts associated with manufacturing our stuff and then the understanding of what solutions are available to reduce this embodied energy, especially in electronics is still in its infancy compared with other energy demands that we are more familiar with like the solutions available for space heating and transport, both of which have solutions that can achieve 70-90% energy reductions without reducing the level of comfort or distance travelled <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sustainable-energy.">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sustainable-energy.</a><br /><br />We're particular conscious of this question at OpenEnergyMonitor as we get our hardware manufactured and see the quantity of stuff involved in the production of our equipment. It has always been interesting to read about developments from other projects and companies who have been looking at this for sometime but in different fields predominantly outdoor clothing: <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/footprint">http://www.patagonia.com/us/footprint</a> and <a href="http://www.howies.co.uk/">http://www.howies.co.uk</a>. They have often achieved quite substantial improvements by looking at their materials, and supply chains in detail.<br /><br />With Open Source Circular Economy Days coming up and after talking to Erica Purvis of <a href="http://technicalnature.org.uk/">http://technicalnature.org.uk/</a> who is one of the organisers of the London even we decided to try and sketch out a draft initial analysis of the embodied energy associated with the emonpi to take along with us. I emphasised its initial status there because I don’t have a high confidence in the reliability&nbsp; of the data at the moment but I think it does provide a useful start on which further detailed research can be done.<br /><br /><b>Embodied Energy Audit Process</b><br /><br />With a little research I found an example of an embodied energy analysis for an LED light with an accompanying dataset for the embodied energy of different components here: <a href="http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf">http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf</a> this example referenced data from the European commission project&nbsp; Eco-design of energy-using products: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.">http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.</a><br /><br />I then calculated an estimate for embodied energy by using the embodied energy dataset from these two sources and a detailed list of components for the emonpi including the weight of each component. The spreadsheet with the calculation can be downloaded here on the EmonPI open hardware github repository:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/raw/master/emonPi/emonPi_V1_5/emonpi_embodiedenergy.ods">https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/raw/master/emonPi/emonPi_V1_5/emonpi_embodiedenergy.ods </a><br /><br />here's a screenshot of what it looks like:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lABYn1a7cMM/VWyZvr5dIKI/AAAAAAAAR8k/d_QjLgYKRXk/s1600/emodiedenergycalc.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="284" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lABYn1a7cMM/VWyZvr5dIKI/AAAAAAAAR8k/d_QjLgYKRXk/s640/emodiedenergycalc.png" width="640" /></a></div><br /><br />I have summarised the main results in these two graphics:<br /><br /><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WhIT__7XvzI/VWyZordmN9I/AAAAAAAAR8c/8-9FteeWTz8/s1600/emonpiembodiedenergy01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="289" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WhIT__7XvzI/VWyZordmN9I/AAAAAAAAR8c/8-9FteeWTz8/s640/emonpiembodiedenergy01.png" width="640" /></a></div>Interestingly the application of the embodied energy values in the dataset suggest that at least for the parts that we are most involved in the custom design of (The EmonPi Shield and the aluminium enclosure) the embodied energy is dominated first by the enclosure at 10.1 kWh and then by the manufacturing of the printed circuit board (2.2 kWh) and the assembly of the unit (1.6 kWh). The integrated circuits only account for a relatively small percentage at 0.2 kWh.<br /><br /><b>Aluminium enclosures</b><br />The estimate for the embodied energy of the aluminium enclosure is based on the 40 kWh/kg figure in Sustainable Energy without the hot air. This equates to 144 MJ/kg which is lower than a couple of other figures I could find for standard aluminium embodied energy. The Wikipedia figure is 155MJ/kg and is based on a 33% recycling rate. The figures I could find for the embodied energy for aluminium from bauxite where between 191MJ/kg and 342MJ/kg. The enclosure made from aluminium from bauxite could at the higher end use 24 kWh and at the lower end require 16 kWh. 100% Recycled aluminium however only requires between 11.35MJ/kg and 17MJ/kg. The EmonPi manufactured from 100% recycled aluminium would therefore only need between 0.9 - 1.3 kWh to manufacture. The EmonTH ABS plastic case is about a third of the size of the EmonPI case and weighs 32g it had an embodied energy of around 1.0 kWh (111MJ/kg). A plastic EmonPi case might weight about 3x this (~90 grams) and so may use around 3.0 kWh. The aluminium would need have been recycled around 7-8 times to achieve the same level of embodied energy as an ABS plastic enclosure. There are also lower embodied energy plastics available such as Polypropylene (64-94MJ/kg) and recycled PET&nbsp; may use around 42-55MJ/kg and then perhaps there are even more options in the design of enclosures to minimise the amount of material used.<br /><b><br />Manufacture of printed circuit boards and assembly</b><br />Beyond learning more about enclosure options it would be useful to focus on getting a better idea for the reliability of the data for printed circuit board manufacturing and assembly and what options exist to lower their embodied energy requirements.<br /><br /><b>OSCEDays</b><br />If your interested in learning more about the Open Source Circular Economy days event or joining us at the event in London have a look at the event pages here:<br /><a href="https://oscedays.org/">https://oscedays.org</a><br /><a href="https://oscedays.org/london">https://oscedays.org/london</a><br /><b><br />Useful links and references:</b><br /><ul><li><a href="http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf">http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf</a></li><li><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.">http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.</a></li><li><a href="http://energy-solution.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/What-We-Know-and-Don---t-Know-about-Embodied-Energy-and-Greenhouse_Energy-Solutions_ACEEE-2012.pdf">http://energy-solution.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/What-We-Know-and-Don---t-Know-about-Embodied-Energy-and-Greenhouse_Energy-Solutions_ACEEE-2012.pdf</a></li><li><a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c15/page_88.shtml">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c15/page_88.shtml</a></li><li><a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Life_cycle_analysis_of_polymer_recycling_literature_review">http://www.appropedia.org/Life_cycle_analysis_of_polymer_recycling_literature_review</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/ethical-and-sustainable-electronics.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/ethical-and-sustainable-electronics.html</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/faire-maus.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/faire-maus.html</a></li><li><a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/embodied-energy-of-electronic-enclosure.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/embodied-energy-of-electronic-enclosure.html</a></li></ul>

  <div class="entry-content clearfix">
    Sadly as of last week we have run out of emonGLCD kits in the shop and have decided to discontinue the emonGLCD for the moment. Preparing the through-hole kits is very labour intensive and the time and skill required to solder assemble is lagging behind our other pre-assembled SMT units.<br /><br />Work has begun on a SMT pre-assembled replacement (<a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/node/5374">see forum thread</a>). However this would probably require significant investment in injection moulding tooling and commitment to high volume production. This would not would be a problem if we were sure on the design. However, I'm not sure if a standalone display is the right avenue to go down...<br /><br />I am aware there that there is certainly value in an 'always on' wall mount / coffee table energy display. Being able to easily glance at the display throughout the day when your home really does remind me to switch off lights and appliances when not in use. As well as checking everything is turned off (base level energy consumption) when leaving the house. An always on display gives users a 'feel' for how much energy various devices use as the display increases or decreases in real-time as a device is switched on or turned off.<br /><br />The future is mobile, everyone has at least one mobile device and increasingly as these devices are upgraded there are a large number of perfectly working just a bit slow older devices which could easily be given a second life as an energy display. This could help reduce the number of devices which end up being recycled or worse put into landfill, therefore helping to save energy in more ways the one! Old second hand android phones or tablets can be picked up on Ebay for less than we could make an emonGLCD!<br /><br />I recently repurposed an old Nexus 7 tablet (2012 model) with a cracked screen as a home energy display displaying Emoncms MyElectric. I installed <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.nbondarchuk.android.keepscn&amp;hl=en">an app</a>&nbsp;to keep the screen on all the time when plugged in charging. The tablet uses 5W of power. An added advantage of using a mobile device as an energy display is they are 'mobile'! The display can easily be moved around the house to support investigation power consumption of various appliances.<br /><br />Much work could be done on the software side to make a really nice packaged android app for Emoncms which would support an energy display mode, useful features might be:<br /><br /><ul><li>Intelligent screen-on-off e.g the display could turn off at night, when energy falls to base level consumption indicating the house is unoccupied&nbsp;</li><li>Using the tablets motion / proximity / light sensor to sense movement to turn screen on-off</li><li>If device has an&nbsp;AMOLED display only certain pixels could be lit up to save power, like on the <a href="http://www.androidcentral.com/moto-x-best-feature-active-display">Moto-x Active Display&nbsp;</a></li><li>Auto start at startup and full screen mode&nbsp;</li><li>Home screen widget to be used if user does not want to decicate a devices solely as an energy display or to be placed on current mobile home screen to enable quick checking of power consumption / temperature etc when out and about. &nbsp; &nbsp;</li></ul><br /><br /><table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"><tbody><tr><td style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CrEw0VbSe2Y/VQqrwBhpBZI/AAAAAAABF6A/LcUyS_41CF4/s1600/CAN-eRQWcAAP8y0.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-CrEw0VbSe2Y/VQqrwBhpBZI/AAAAAAABF6A/LcUyS_41CF4/s1600/CAN-eRQWcAAP8y0.jpg" height="426" width="640" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;">Emoncms MyElectric on Nexus 7 with cracked screen</td></tr></tbody></table><br />A super low power alternative could be to use an old e-reader with an E-ink display.
