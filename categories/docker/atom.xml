    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have made the first steps towards running Emoncms to run in a <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> container.</p>

<p>Dockerfiles and setup notes are in the emoncms-docker repository:</p>

<p>Docker is an exciting tool to help make development, testing and deployment of web-applications easier.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-docker-the-short-version">What is docker? (the short version):</h2>

<blockquote>
  <p>Docker containers wrap a piece of software in a complete filesystem that contains everything needed to run: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries – anything that can be installed on a server. This guarantees that the software will always run the same, regardless of its environment.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="what-is-docker-the-long-version">What is docker? (the long version):</h3>

<blockquote>
  <p>Docker is an open-source platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="quick-start">Quick Start</h2>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>$ docker pull openenergymonitor/emoncms
$ git clone https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms-docker
$ cd emoncms-docker
$ docker-compose up
</code></pre>
</div>

<p><strong>That’s it! Emoncms should now be runnning, browse to <a href="http://localhost:8080">http://localhost:8080</a></strong></p>

<h2 id="emoncms-docker">Emoncms Docker</h2>

<p>Using Docker it’s possible to fire up Emoncms on a bare system (assuming Docker is installed) in a couple of minutes with all the LAMP install &amp; config taken care of.</p>

<p>This is great for development since it’s possible to play about with Emoncms running in a Docker container without fear of messing up your system or production Emoncms install.</p>

<p>In the future, Docker can even be used as a deployment tool for Emoncms. In theory, it should possible to deploy the Emoncms Docker container on any server within minutes.</p>

<p>We have taken a multi-container approach with php-apache running in one container and the MYSQL database running in another. The containers are linked using <a href="https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/">docker-compose</a>.</p>

<p><strong>See <a href="https://github.com/emoncms/emoncms-docker">emoncms-docker Readme</a> for setup &amp; build instructions.</strong></p>

<p><em>Note: The Emoncms docker setup is currently in development and not recomended for production Emoncms deployment just yet.</em></p>
