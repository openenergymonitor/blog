    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last week my home emonPi energy monitor came in handy to help diagnose an electrical supply fault.</p>

<p>A neighbour alerted me that her lights were flickering and internet router was dropping offline. At the time I was doing some DIY and had noticed the power drill I was using change speed erratically. I had presumed it was my drill about the give up the ghost.</p>

<p>I checked the Emoncms graph on my emonPi energy monitor and noticed that VRMS was well out of spec at about 150V (we usually get 230V*) and occasionally jumping up to almost 300V! The electrical company was alerted and the fault was traced back to a frayed conductor on our street. I helped the electrical contractors view the real-time VRMS value to confirm the fault was fixed.</p>

<h2 id="-notes-on-mains-voltage-limits">* Notes on Mains Voltage Limits</h2>

<p>The standard domestic mains supply for Europe is 230 V ± 10%, giving a lower limit of 207 V and an upper limit of 253 V. It is permissible under BS 7671 to have a voltage drop within the installation of 5%, which would give a lower limit of 195.5 V.
The UK standard prior to harmonization was 240 V ± 6%, giving an upper limit of 254.4 V.</p>

<p>Although the UK nominal standard is now 230 V, the supply system has not generally been adjusted, and the voltage centers around 240 V.</p>

<p>Thanks to Robert Wall for summarizing the rather convoluted standards surrounding UK grid voltages.</p>

<p>All of Europe, Africa, Asia, Australia, New Zealand and most of South America, use a supply that is within 6% of 230 V</p>
