    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html">investigation into the embodied energy that it takes to make an energy monitor</a>, I thought I would explore in a little more detail the embodied energy of the microcontroller which is often associated with the most energy intensive aspect of electronics manufacture.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Atk61lU9PJg/VZm5VQZtIlI/AAAAAAAATbw/WKqu8g7mhh4/s1600/atmegaemonpi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Atk61lU9PJg/VZm5VQZtIlI/AAAAAAAATbw/WKqu8g7mhh4/s1600/atmegaemonpi.jpg" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />As I mentioned before I wouldn’t put a large amount of confidence in the accuracy of the figures below, computer chips are incredibly complex things that take a large number of manufacturing processes to make and I have found it hard to find open detailed information on energy requirements of these. The calculations below are based on the datasets that I could find including the EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/index_en.htm">ecodesign dataset</a> which I’m told is one of the higher quality freely available sources. But I could not find much detail on how the figures where derived to know what it does and does not include and the breakdown of energy use in its manufacture.<br /><br />The idea here is more to get an initial set of numbers that could be improved upon in the future. My motivation for looking into this started by being inspired by <a href="http://www.howies.co.uk/">howies</a> and <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/footprint">patagonia’s</a> efforts on footprint and supply chain analysis, partly by reading <a href="http://withouthotair.com/c15/page_88.shtml">sustainable energy without the hot air</a> that identifies industry as being a significant part of overall energy use and also after reading the article here about <a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html">‘the monster footprint of digital technology’.</a><br /><br />The following starts by looking at the available datasets and then investigates deriving figures for the embodied energy of a chip by calculation of the actual semiconductor volume contained which compares well for the small IC embodied energy value.<br /><br /><b>1) Datasets</b><br /><br /><b>EU Ecodesign methodology</b><br />The EU ecodesign methodology downloadable here <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/5308/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native">http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/5308/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native</a> provides embodied energy values for a variety of electronic component categories, it provides two embodied energy values for IC’s (integrated circuits) these are:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Large IC                        8021.88 MJ/kg</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Small IC                        1786.73 MJ/kg</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">MJ/kg: 1,000,000 Joules per kg </span><br /><br />The question is what constitutes a small or large IC? Dimensions? processing power? and there is a large difference between both of these values!<br /><br />Another paper that lists sources for embodied energy values including the EU ecodesign dataset is this paper on the embodied energy of an offgrid light<a href="http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf">: http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf</a>. It lists two other useful values:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Semiconductor Grade Si             35000 MJ/kg, Taiariol et al. 2001</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">EPROM Chip (M27C1001, 0.36 W IC)   12.5 MJ/chip,  Taiariol et al. 2001</span><br /><br />Jean Claude Wippler of JeeLabs did an interesting post a couple of years ago on what is inside an ATmega8 chip. The Silicon part was extracted by dissolving the outer casing with sulphuric and nitric acid. <a href="http://jeelabs.org/2013/06/09/whats-inside-that-chip">http://jeelabs.org/2013/06/09/whats-inside-that-chip</a><br /><br />The size of the semiconductor part inside the ATmega8 is 2855 x 2795 um, less than 3x3mm:<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QvJnGzXeRLg/VZmgRUCvqgI/AAAAAAAATbM/Keu1ATBsQ0g/s1600/siliconchip.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="387" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QvJnGzXeRLg/VZmgRUCvqgI/AAAAAAAATbM/Keu1ATBsQ0g/s400/siliconchip.png" width="400" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />Is it possible to estimate the embodied energy of a microcontroller by working out the embodied energy of the silicon part and the casing part separately? and how would the figure compare with the embodied energy values given for a small and large IC in the EU ecodesign dataset?<br /><br /><b>Thickness</b><br />To find the embodied energy of the silicon part we need to first work out the weight of that part. To do this we will need the density and thickness of the silicon wafer. The thickness of a silicon wafer can be anywhere between 275um and 926um.<br /><br /><b>Density of silicon:</b> 2.3290 g.cm3 https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Silicon<br /><br /><b>Weight</b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">2855 x 2795 um x 275 um = 0.00219 cm3 x 2.329 g.m3 = 0.0051 g</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">2855 x 2795 um x 625 um = 0.00499 cm3 x 2.329 g.m3 = 0.0116 g</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">2855 x 2795 um x 926 um = 0.00739 cm3 x 2.329 g.m3 = 0.0172 g</span><br /><br />The embodied energy of silicon grade Si is around 35000 MJ/kg, 35 MJ/g<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">0.0051 g x 35MJ/g = 0.178 MJ = 0.049 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">0.0116 g x 35 MJ/g = 0.406 MJ = 0.113 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">0.0172 g x 35 MJ/g = 0.602 MJ = 0.167 kWh</span><br /><br />The weight of a SMT Atmega 328 is 0.14375g:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Large IC: 8021.88 MJ/kg = 1.153 MJ = 0.320 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Small IC: 1786.73 MJ/kg = 0.257 MJ = 0.071 kWh</span><br /><br />The EPROM Chip (M27C1001, 0.36 W IC) example is 12.5 MJ/chip = 3.47 kWh<br />Which is between 10 and 50x the large/small IC estimates and 20 to 70x the wafer only estimates.<br /><br />The large IC is between 2x and 6x the wafer only and small IC is between 0.5x to 1.5x the wafer only estimate.<br /><br />The weight of the silicon part of the chip for the ATmega8 should be between 3.5% to 12% of the total chip weight.<br /><br />The rest of the weight is metal and plastic. Copper has an embodied energy of between 38MJ/kg and 142MJ/kg depending on manufacturing process and plastic is anywhere between 80-120MJ/kg. If we assume a copper/plastic mix of around 100MJ/kg as a rough estimate.<br /><br />This would then contribute an additional 0.0132 MJ = 0.0037 kWh which would only increase the embodied energy of the chip by around 2-7%.<br /><br />Our estimate therefore for the embodied energy of the small microcontroller is between 0.053 kWh and 0.171 kWh, mid range of 0.117 kWh for 625um wafer which compares well with the small IC estimate of 0.071 kWh (it is of the right magnitude). We would expect a certain amount of assembly energy for combining the plastic, copper and semiconductor parts which is not included when taking a constituent parts approach which will likely add a little more to the total.<br /><b><br />Package type?</b><br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WazQBqTygXI/VZm3wiRIuFI/AAAAAAAATbk/d2LwHZ6TahA/s1600/packagetype.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="125" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WazQBqTygXI/VZm3wiRIuFI/AAAAAAAATbk/d2LwHZ6TahA/s400/packagetype.jpg" width="400" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />Calculating the embodied energy this way brings up an important question about the package type of the IC, I.e how much plastic and connector metal surrounds the semiconductor core. If the size of the semiconductor inside a through-hole and SMT version of a ATmega328 is the same then surely a total weight based measure is not a good guide for the embodied energy. Given that over 90% the embodied energy is associated with 3.5 - 12% of the weight.<br /><br /><b>RaspberryPi chips</b><br />The ATmega8 or ATmega328 is not a particularly powerful chip, the emonpi also uses a RaspberryPi which has three chips on board.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PdjkOiAbz6U/VZm2iti-xgI/AAAAAAAATbc/MFm6leg9lsI/s1600/Pi2ModB1GB_-comp.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PdjkOiAbz6U/VZm2iti-xgI/AAAAAAAATbc/MFm6leg9lsI/s400/Pi2ModB1GB_-comp.jpeg" width="400" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />Its not clear what the volumes of the semiconductors inside these chips are. But given their small size and relatively large processing power lets assume for an initial calculation that the size of the package is very close to the size of the semiconductor. If the wafer thickness is 625um then the embodied energy of the chips can be estimated as:<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Broadcom        14 x 14 mm x 625um = ~2.8 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Elpida          12 x 12 mm x 625um = ~2.0 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Smst            8.7 x 8.7 mm x 625um = ~1.1 kWh</span><br /><br />These estimates which cover a quad core 900Mhz + 1GB ram computer are much larger than the ATmega8 estimate as we would expect but are still significantly lower than the embodied energy figure given for the 32MB 2g memory chip referenced in the article on the <a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html">the monster footprint of digital technology</a> of 20 kWh - while delivering much more functionality, almost a full computer! <br /><br />Are these figures accurate? are the underlying datasets accurate for modern processors? Does it mean that newer miniaturised technology with the ability to pack much more computing power inside the same volume of semiconductor has resulted in a significant reduction in the embodied energy for equivalent amounts of computing digital technology functionality? These are all significant guesses at the moment and it would be really interesting and useful to see more open data available on the embodied energy of newer technology. It would be good to see greater interest from the manufacturers of these chips in calculating and giving information on the embodied energy of their products, making data available on this would really help with understanding this question about the impact of technology.</p>

<p><br />Three weeks ago, time runs fast! I attended the open source circular economy event OSCEdays in London. It was a fantastic event with a lot of energy and ideas exploring how  the circular economy could benefit from an open source approach.<br /><br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_Gn7kS9kGMQ/VZl965UyCJI/AAAAAAAATak/UMpLQ-RQ6-E/s1600/oscedays.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="260" src="https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-_Gn7kS9kGMQ/VZl965UyCJI/AAAAAAAATak/UMpLQ-RQ6-E/s400/oscedays.jpeg" width="400" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;OSCEdays at FabLab London&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;<br />&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;<br />&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iVHrLVdqWpY/VZl_FM3RFkI/AAAAAAAATas/FpO29-jdQSo/s1600/bda5d194978a0361.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="180" src="https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-iVHrLVdqWpY/VZl_FM3RFkI/AAAAAAAATas/FpO29-jdQSo/s400/bda5d194978a0361.png" width="400" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html">Initial draft embodied energy analysis of the emonpi</a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;There was a wide range of challenges and projects there including: circular makerspaces submitted by <a href="http://www.greatrecovery.org.uk/">the great recovery</a> looking at how fablab’s and makerspaces could encourage circular thinking, an initiative developing re-usable containers for cosmetics, a challenge looking at the implications of the circular economy for wearable technologies, ‘trust is not waste’ by <a href="http://www.therubbishdiet.org.uk/">the rubbish diet project</a> and ours looking at the embodied energy and lifecycle analysis of the OpenEnergyMonitor EmonPi.<br /><br />Id like to thank Rachel Stanley, David Green, WoonTan and Paidi Creed for all their help and input and for Erica Purvis and Sharon Prendeville for organising the event and the wider team that where involved in running the event in many other cities around the world.<br /><br />Our discussions and findings are partly documented here, there’s also a bit more that needs writing up which will be online soon: <a href="http://community.oscedays.org/t/headline-challenge-open-energy-life-cycles/662/2">http://community.oscedays.org/t/headline-challenge-open-energy-life-cycles/662/2</a>.<br /><br />The research that I did on the embodied energy of the emonpi in the lead up to the event can be found here: <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html</a><i> </i><br /><br />We are really interested in the lifecycle impacts and embodied energy side of OpenEnergyMonitor and so were going to keep building on this.

    <id>https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On the 12th – 14th of June there is an event happening called Open Source Circular Economy Days in many cities around the world, including in London <a href="https://oscedays.org/london/">https://oscedays.org/london/ </a>which we will be attending. I first found out about the event from Lars Zimmerman who is on the core organising team and I met last year at OuiShare, Lars runs <a href="http://openitagency.eu/">http://openitagency.eu</a> encouraging and helping people incorporate open source in their businesses, organisations and projects. The aim of Open Source Circular Economy Days is to bring open source thinking to the circular economy. The energy associated with manufacturing is a large part of our overall energy consumption and the question of embodied energy especially in the zero carbon energy sector is particularly important to understand better. There is quite a bit of discussion at the moment about the level of energy return on energy invested EROI required from the zero carbon energy sector as a whole in order to sustain a certain level of technological society.<br /><br />My impression of trying to look into embodied energy and life cycle analysis is that it seems that the measurement of embodied energy and other impacts associated with manufacturing our stuff and then the understanding of what solutions are available to reduce this embodied energy, especially in electronics is still in its infancy compared with other energy demands that we are more familiar with like the solutions available for space heating and transport, both of which have solutions that can achieve 70-90% energy reductions without reducing the level of comfort or distance travelled <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sustainable-energy.">http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/sustainable-energy.</a><br /><br />We’re particular conscious of this question at OpenEnergyMonitor as we get our hardware manufactured and see the quantity of stuff involved in the production of our equipment. It has always been interesting to read about developments from other projects and companies who have been looking at this for sometime but in different fields predominantly outdoor clothing: <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/footprint">http://www.patagonia.com/us/footprint</a> and <a href="http://www.howies.co.uk/">http://www.howies.co.uk</a>. They have often achieved quite substantial improvements by looking at their materials, and supply chains in detail.<br /><br />With Open Source Circular Economy Days coming up and after talking to Erica Purvis of <a href="http://technicalnature.org.uk/">http://technicalnature.org.uk/</a> who is one of the organisers of the London even we decided to try and sketch out a draft initial analysis of the embodied energy associated with the emonpi to take along with us. I emphasised its initial status there because I don’t have a high confidence in the reliability  of the data at the moment but I think it does provide a useful start on which further detailed research can be done.<br /><br /><b>Embodied Energy Audit Process</b><br /><br />With a little research I found an example of an embodied energy analysis for an LED light with an accompanying dataset for the embodied energy of different components here: <a href="http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf">http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf</a> this example referenced data from the European commission project  Eco-design of energy-using products: <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.">http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.</a><br /><br />I then calculated an estimate for embodied energy by using the embodied energy dataset from these two sources and a detailed list of components for the emonpi including the weight of each component. The spreadsheet with the calculation can be downloaded here on the EmonPI open hardware github repository:<br /><br /><a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/raw/master/emonPi/emonPi_V1_5/emonpi_embodiedenergy.ods">https://github.com/openenergymonitor/Hardware/raw/master/emonPi/emonPi_V1_5/emonpi_embodiedenergy.ods </a><br /><br />here’s a screenshot of what it looks like:<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lABYn1a7cMM/VWyZvr5dIKI/AAAAAAAAR8k/d_QjLgYKRXk/s1600/emodiedenergycalc.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="284" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-lABYn1a7cMM/VWyZvr5dIKI/AAAAAAAAR8k/d_QjLgYKRXk/s640/emodiedenergycalc.png" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br /><br />I have summarised the main results in these two graphics:<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WhIT__7XvzI/VWyZordmN9I/AAAAAAAAR8c/8-9FteeWTz8/s1600/emonpiembodiedenergy01.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="289" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WhIT__7XvzI/VWyZordmN9I/AAAAAAAAR8c/8-9FteeWTz8/s640/emonpiembodiedenergy01.png" width="640" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;Interestingly the application of the embodied energy values in the dataset suggest that at least for the parts that we are most involved in the custom design of (The EmonPi Shield and the aluminium enclosure) the embodied energy is dominated first by the enclosure at 10.1 kWh and then by the manufacturing of the printed circuit board (2.2 kWh) and the assembly of the unit (1.6 kWh). The integrated circuits only account for a relatively small percentage at 0.2 kWh.<br /><br /><b>Aluminium enclosures</b><br />The estimate for the embodied energy of the aluminium enclosure is based on the 40 kWh/kg figure in Sustainable Energy without the hot air. This equates to 144 MJ/kg which is lower than a couple of other figures I could find for standard aluminium embodied energy. The Wikipedia figure is 155MJ/kg and is based on a 33% recycling rate. The figures I could find for the embodied energy for aluminium from bauxite where between 191MJ/kg and 342MJ/kg. The enclosure made from aluminium from bauxite could at the higher end use 24 kWh and at the lower end require 16 kWh. 100% Recycled aluminium however only requires between 11.35MJ/kg and 17MJ/kg. The EmonPi manufactured from 100% recycled aluminium would therefore only need between 0.9 - 1.3 kWh to manufacture. The EmonTH ABS plastic case is about a third of the size of the EmonPI case and weighs 32g it had an embodied energy of around 1.0 kWh (111MJ/kg). A plastic EmonPi case might weight about 3x this (~90 grams) and so may use around 3.0 kWh. The aluminium would need have been recycled around 7-8 times to achieve the same level of embodied energy as an ABS plastic enclosure. There are also lower embodied energy plastics available such as Polypropylene (64-94MJ/kg) and recycled PET  may use around 42-55MJ/kg and then perhaps there are even more options in the design of enclosures to minimise the amount of material used.<br /><b><br />Manufacture of printed circuit boards and assembly</b><br />Beyond learning more about enclosure options it would be useful to focus on getting a better idea for the reliability of the data for printed circuit board manufacturing and assembly and what options exist to lower their embodied energy requirements.<br /><br /><b>OSCEDays</b><br />If your interested in learning more about the Open Source Circular Economy days event or joining us at the event in London have a look at the event pages here:<br /><a href="https://oscedays.org/">https://oscedays.org</a><br /><a href="https://oscedays.org/london">https://oscedays.org/london</a><br /><b><br />Useful links and references:</b><br />&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf">http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.">http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/files/eup_ecoreport_v5_en.xls.</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://energy-solution.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/What-We-Know-and-Don---t-Know-about-Embodied-Energy-and-Greenhouse_Energy-Solutions_ACEEE-2012.pdf">http://energy-solution.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/What-We-Know-and-Don—t-Know-about-Embodied-Energy-and-Greenhouse_Energy-Solutions_ACEEE-2012.pdf</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c15/page_88.shtml">http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/withouthotair/c15/page_88.shtml</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://www.appropedia.org/Life_cycle_analysis_of_polymer_recycling_literature_review">http://www.appropedia.org/Life_cycle_analysis_of_polymer_recycling_literature_review</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/ethical-and-sustainable-electronics.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/08/ethical-and-sustainable-electronics.html</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/faire-maus.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2013/09/faire-maus.html</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;<a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/embodied-energy-of-electronic-enclosure.html">http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2012/05/embodied-energy-of-electronic-enclosure.html</a>&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;</p>
