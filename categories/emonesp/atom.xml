</ul>

<hr />

<p>Following on from my last couple of posts in this series we now have a working continuous cloud-based build &amp; test (firmware compiling) flow using PlatformIO and TravisCI, to quickly recap:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Code change is committed to the <a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP">EmonESP repo on GitHub</a></li>
  <li>TravisCI triggers a build (compile) using PlatformIO running in a TravisCI container in the cloud.</li>
  <li>If build/compilation process fails we get an email alert, if pull-request we get a warning before merging if proposed changes break the build.</li>
  <li>If a Git commit is tagged as a release the build process uploads the generated compiled binary (.bin) to the repo GitHub release page.</li>
</ol>

<p>The next step is to get the compiled binary from GitHub-releases (EmonESP in this example) deployed to a WiFi connected production ESP8266. Here’s the user facing EmonESP web-interface for this firmware update process:</p>

<p><img src="/images/emonesp-update.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The OTA (over-the-air) firmware deployment process is based on Daniel Eichhorn’s (<a href="https://twitter.com/squix78">@squix78</a>) <a href="http://blog.squix.org/2016/06/esp8266-continuous-delivery-pipeline-push-to-production.html">excellent blog post</a>. In summary the process is as follows:</p>

<p><img src="/images/esp-update-process.png" alt="image" />
Diagram from <a href="http://blog.squix.org/2016/06/esp8266-continuous-delivery-pipeline-push-to-production.html">Daniel Eichhorn’s blog</a></p>

<ul>
  <li>The build is tagged with a version number using PlatformIO build-flag, see EmonESP <a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP/blob/master/platformio.ini">platformio.ini</a>.</li>
  <li>An intermediate PHP script connects to the GitHub API to check the latest release version and returns this as a string.</li>
  <li>ESP sends it’s current running firmware version to the PHP script using tag argument <code class="highlighter-rouge">&amp;tag=1.0.2</code>.</li>
  <li>If the running firmware version does not match the latest release version, the PHP script grabs the latest release .bin from github-releases API and serves it up as a download to the ESP.</li>
  <li>ESP then flashes the compiled .bin OTA update using the <a href="https://github.com/esp8266/Arduino/tree/master/libraries">ESP8266httpUpdate library</a> which is built-in to the espressif Arduino tool-chain</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="intermediate-php-script">Intermediate PHP script</h3>

<p>Ideally the production ESP8266 would be able to contact the GitHub-release API directly negating the need for the intermediate PHP script. However, there are a number of reasons why this is not practical at the moment. To quote Daniel’s blog post:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>The ESPhttpUpdate currently cannot follow redirects. This is important since github hosts the release artefacts on Amazon AWS. But in the API JSON &gt; object the address points to github, so the http client has to follow a redirect to download the artefact.</li>
    <li>Github uses https for its API and will redirect you to it if you are trying plain HTTP. This means that you would have to know the SSL fingerprints &gt; of the github API server and the AWS hosting instance since this is required by the ESPs secure client interface. After all the ESPs don’t have a chain &gt; of trusted certificates stored somewhere. While the fingerprint of the github API might be stable, the redirection on Amazon AWS might not always use &gt; the same certificate.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>There is currently working example of this process (ESP8266 firmware + intermediate PHP script) in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">ota</code> branch of <a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/EmonESP">EmonESP GitHub Repo</a>.</strong></p>

<h3 id="security">Security</h3>

<p><strong>In it’s current implementation the update process described above is not secure.</strong></p>

<p>Obviously secure delivery and verification of the update binary is essential.</p>

<p>Ideally the binary download to the ESP would be done over secure https. This maybe be possible, however https support on the ESP is currently not super stable and limited by the available memory (as mentioned above).</p>

<p>A method to verify the compiled binary could be to sign the compiled binary with a private key which is verified by the ESP before firmware is updated.</p>

<p>I would be interested to hear from anyone with any thoughts / advice as to how secure ESP OTA firmware delivery can be achieved.</p>

    <updated>2016-06-20T10:00:00+00:00</updated>
    <id>https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2016/06/esp8266-emonesp-developments</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Glyn and I have been doing a bit of development recently on using the ESP8266 WiFi board with OpenEnergyMonitor hardware, we are quite excited about the potential of this little module to both reduce the cost of the system and simplify setup and installation especially for applications that primarily post to a remote emoncms server such as <a href="https://emoncms.org">emoncms.org</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> we have no plans to discontinue developments and support for Raspberry Pi based systems e.g. emonPi / emonBase. Quite the opposite: the local storage and processing of a Raspberry Pi based system has many advantages particularly for systems requiring more flexibility and customisation e.g Local Emoncms storage. MQTT, openHAB &amp; nodeRED integration. The ESP developments will be ran in parallel, in fact ESP could be configured to post to an emonPi / emonBase via MQTT for local on-site storage and integration.</p>

<p>We are at the moment working on three initial uses of the ESP8266:</p>

<h2 id="emontx-v3--esp8266-module">1. <strong>EmonTx V3</strong> + ESP8266 module</h2>

<p>We are initially using the Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 module as a development platform. For anyone keen to get going with the ESP8266 Huzzah module it is available from a number of places such as <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471">adafruit</a> (USA) and <a href="https://shop.pimoroni.com/products/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout">Pimoroni</a> (UK). Any ESP8266 with ESP-12 module should work the same. See lower in the post for EmonESP firmware dev.</p>

<p><img src="/images/emontx-esp.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>There will be another post very soon detailing how to use this module with the EmonTx v3.</p>

<!--more-->

<h2 id="heatpumpenergy-monitor">2. Heatpump/Energy Monitor</h2>

<p>Heatpump / energy monitor through-hole development board, essentially and EmonTx v2 with additional features for interfacing with heat meters and multiple DS18B20 temperature sensors as well as an integrated ESP8266 WIFI module.</p>

<p><img src="/images/heatpumpmonitor.png" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The heatpump monitor board currently supports:</p>

<ul>
  <li>3x CT + ACAC Channels</li>
  <li>Elster A100C Irda meter reader (watt hours)</li>
  <li>Pulse Counting</li>
  <li>Supports MBUS heat meters (Kamstrup 402)</li>
  <li>Supports SIKA flow meters</li>
  <li>4x DS18B20 Temperature Sensors</li>
  <li>Miniature solid state relay for heating control (not yet tested)</li>
  <li>ESP8266 Low cost Wifi</li>
  <li>RFM69 option</li>
  <li>Raspberry PI connector option</li>
  <li>A Through-hole ESP Wifi development platform</li>
  <li>Fits in the EmonTx V3 Aluminum case</li>
</ul>

<p>Guide cost ~£50 (ex VAT) for full heatpump monitor kit with case, ~£30 (ex VAT) for cut down WIFI energy monitor only kit without case.. To be finalised.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/openenergymonitor/HeatpumpMonitor">See Heatpump monitor development repo</a></p>

<h2 id="esp8266-based-wifi-pixel-energy-display">3. ESP8266 based WIFI Pixel Energy Display,</h2>

<p>This is an idea thanks to David Hunninsett (<a href="http://twitter.com/m0untainpenguin">@m0untainpenguin</a>) with hardware being developed by <a href="https://github.com/Protoneer/WifiPixels">Protoneer</a>. It fits into a project we are more recently part of here in North Wales called <a href="http://www.energylocal.co.uk/cydynni/">CydYnni by EnergyLocal</a> where 100 households within the boundary of the substation get cheap electricity when a local community hydro is running. David Hunninsett is one of the households on the project and he is keen to have a display that shows when it’s a good time to use electricity among other uses. The wifi pixel could become a nice platform for a ambient home energy indicator.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/davehun/mqtt-wifi-pixel">See software development  repo on</a></p>

<h1 id="emonesp-easier-setup-and-installation">EmonESP, easier setup and installation</h1>

<p>One of the really nice things about using the ESP module is that it can really simplify setup for installations that only need to post to a remote emoncms server. The wifi module starts by broadcasting a hotspot that you connect to directly, you can then scan for wifi networks, select the network, get the ip address of the monitor on the network (which saves using fing or accessing your router device list), enter your emoncms.org apikey to connect to an emoncms.org account (to be replaced with username and passowrd login + ability to register and link the monitor to a emoncms account in one step).</p>

<p><img src="/images/emonesp.jpg" alt="image" /></p>

<p>We plan to extend EmonESP to also support MQTT.</p>

<p>The EmonESP software is based on work by Chris Howel of <a href="http://www.openevse.com">OpenEVSE</a> which is a really nice open hardware electric vehicle charging station, it’s been really nice to find a common development like this that can be beneficial to two open hardware and software projects. OpenEVSE <a href="https://data.openevse.com/">already use Emoncms</a> for logging and graphing.</p>

<h2 id="over-the-air-firmware-upload">Over the air firmware upload</h2>

<p>Glyn has been doing a lot of work on how we can do over the air updates to ESP8266 based units. Being able to do this will make it a lot easier to maintain and keep the firmware on these updated especially as the software goes through the larger number of iterations in initial development. Check out his blog posts here to follow the development:</p>
