    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="http://home-assistant.io/">Home Assistant</a> (HA) is a fully <a href="https://github.com/balloob/home-assistant">open-source</a> home automation platform.</p>

<p>In terms of functionality it’s quite similar to <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/openHAB">openHAB</a> however it’s architecture is very different it runs on Python 3 as opposed to java.</p>

<p>I found home assistant very easy to setup and configure. It’s got some nice auto detect features e.g. It auto-detected by Chromecast devices. Home Assistant has got <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/">pre-built component integrations</a> with many home automation and monitoring devices and platforms. I was also impressed with the presence detection support, I tested using <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.nmap_scanner/">nmap</a> to scan my home router for presence of my phone connected to my home WiFi (indication that I’m home…or I forget my phone!) and <a href="https://home-assistant.io/components/device_tracker.owntracks/">OwnTracks</a> MQTT based GPS tracking.</p>

<p>Interfacing with our <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/modules/emonpi">emonPi Raspberry Pi energy monitor</a> was easy, using MQTT component to connect to emonPi’s MQTT server and subscribe to the power and sensor readings of interest.</p>

<p>As yet I have not experimented with creating automations with HA .e.g turning off lights and heating when we’re not home. I think I will still prefer using nodeRED for these types of rule based automations. However what HA does well is present a nice clean, mobile friendly and easy to configure front-end interface:</p>

Home Assistant has some nice mini graphing features to give you a quick overview.</p>

<p>On a switch node a quite overview will tell you how long the switch has been on or off for. Very useful for checking long long the heating has been on for</p>
