    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I would like to highlight a nice improvement to Emoncms and the Emoncms android app that has been contributed by community memebers <a href="https://community.openenergymonitor.org/users/jumpmaster/activity">@jumpmaster</a> and <a href="https://community.openenergymonitor.org/users/andy_taylor/activity">@andy_taylor</a>. See <a href="https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/mobile-app-qr-code/149">development forum thread</a> on our <a href="/2016/05/website-changes/">shiny new forums</a>.</p>

<p>Emoncms MyAccount page now displays a QR code and a couple of handy ‘Copy to Clipboard’ buttons for the API keys:</p>

<p><em>This updated has been merged into the stable Emoncms branch V9.6. If your running an emonPi/emonBase jsut hit update to pull in the changes. The update will appear on Emoncms.org in the next few days.</em></p>

<p>This QR code contains the Emoncms URL and read-API key to automate setting up the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.emoncms.myapps&amp;hl=en_GB">Emoncms android app</a>. The update for the app to support the QR code scanner has been pushed to Googe Play. After the update just can the QR code to setup the app.</p>

<p>If your feeds are named <strong>use</strong> and <strong>use_kwh</strong> the app will automatically select use these feeds as the Power and kWh feeds.</p>

<p>Any issues, please post on the <a href="https://community.openenergymonitor.org/t/mobile-app-qr-code/149">development forum thread</a>.</p>

<p>Thanks again to everyone involved in the development and testing. It’s been great working with an enthusiastic development community over on the new forums. Onwards and upwards :-)</p>
