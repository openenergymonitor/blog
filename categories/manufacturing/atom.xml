    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><br />For the past two weeks I have been travelling out to the South of China from the UK via overland travel. I have always wanted to visit China but could not bring myself to justify the carbon impact of flying<em>. My journey took me from the UK to Moscow via European trains then the Trans Siberian Railway across Russia and Mongolia to China. It was a fantastic adventure, we broke up the travel by stopping off in various locations on route. I have posted a <a href="http://adventuresplusnorthwales.blogspot.co.uk/search/label/ChinaViaTrain">couple of blog posts</a> on my personal blog accounting the journey.<br /><br /><br />Even though at OpenEnergyMonitor we do most of our manufacturing and assembly locally in the UK there are many components that are only possible to source in China e.g CT sensors, power adapters and RF modules. In fact most electronic components originate in some way from a factory in China. Even though we do our SMT assembly and PCB fabrication in the UK we still rely heavily on Chinese manufacturing. For heavy items like power adapters and CT sensors we purchase in bulk (pallet load) and ship via ocean freight rather than air cargo to reduce carbon footprint.<br /><br />I wanted to visit China to experience the culture and see for myself the working conditions in the factories that supply some of the components we use. No doubt attempting to trace back every factory and company in a supply chain for a complex items such as electronic components is a big task, something large corporation (think Apple and Samsung) have struggled with. We have all heard the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/mar/30/apple-factories-china-foxconn-audit">horror stories</a> of overworked and under-age employees in Chinese electronic factories. <br /><br />My epic train ride to China rolled me into the North of China and Beijing first. After being a tourist for a day and visiting the very ‘great’ Great Wall of China I took a fast train down to Shenzhen. This train was seriously impressive, cruising at a smooth 307 Km/hr. I was glued to the window watching countryside and cities larger than London that I had not heard of fly by. I was aware that China is home to many, many people however this was really evident looking out the window watching huge cities and row upon row of skyscrapers flash by. In every town town and city it seemed many more tower blocks were in the process of being built, there is no doubt that China is undergoing an economic boom. After 8hrs of fast train blur we arrived in Shenzhen, nicknamed together with it’s neighbouring city Guangzhou as the ‘factory of the world’; it’s almost certain that the laptop/tablet/phone you are using to read this was made in factories in these cities.<br />&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;During my time in Shenzhen I visited the world’s largest electronic component market and the HopeRF factory where the RFM12B and RFM69CW RF modules that we use are designed and manufactured. I didn’t manage to visit the factory where our CT sensors are manufactured since this factory was located in the north of China, however I did <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.com/2014/07/how-ct-sensors-are-made.html">post up some photos</a> I was sent from inside the factory a while back.<br /><br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PLBuhsOl6b0/VfhA7o764xI/AAAAAAABiIk/Pj7svsMAx-0/s1600/a_electronic_market_shenzhen.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-PLBuhsOl6b0/VfhA7o764xI/AAAAAAABiIk/Pj7svsMAx-0/s640/a_electronic_market_shenzhen.jpg" width="640" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;<span style="font-size: 12.8px;">Electronic component market in downtown Shenzhen (I’m pictured with the seller of encapsulated DS18B20 temperature sensors that we stock)</span>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Visiting the electronics market in downtown Shenzhen was a fantastically crazy experience. It was amazing to see all types of components carefully organised under the glass counters. There is something satisfyingly tactile about being able to hold different types of connectors and switches to compare quality and dimensions and chat to the seller about the pros, cons and cost of each item. Assuming you could speak Mandarin shopping for components here would be a far more social experience than an online parametric search tool! Obviously prices for these components are significantly cheaper than in the West.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;Before I started working in electronic manufacture I assumed (like I think many people do) that most electronic manufacture is performed by robots. This is mainly true for pick-and-place assembly, however there are many more manufacturing steps which require significant human effort such as thru-hole soldering, testing and final assembly.<br /><br />I am happy to report that the HopeRF I visited was clean, air conditioned and all employees were at least the minimum age, paid at least the minimum wage and worked 8am - 6pm with a 2hr lunch / siesta break. Overtime is common but employees are paid accordingly. All employees I met seems happy, although I did happen to arrive just as they were leaving on their lunch break! On the wall in the corridor there was a notice board with photos showing various company employee group outings including activities such as hill walking, running, swimming and group dinners. I also noticed an employee suggestion box.<br /><br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MvZ5YPP_Ch0/VhDnvOyJyrI/AAAAAAABgYY/OfpSZlkQC_4/s1600/b_HopeRF_factory.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-MvZ5YPP_Ch0/VhDnvOyJyrI/AAAAAAABgYY/OfpSZlkQC_4/s640/b_HopeRF_factory.jpg" width="640" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Hope RF Factory Visit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br /><br />I did get a chance to speak to an engineer at Hope RF who is involved in the design of new modules. As I had presumed the RFM69CW using a more standard IC package is much more suited to reflow soldering and less susceptible to humidity ingression than the older RFM12B design that often used a ‘black blob’ IC package. Second photo down on the left shows a naked RFM12B before receiving it’s ‘blob’ dressing! Interestingly I learned (and witnessed!) that each and every single module is hand tested before leaving the factory. Modules that fail the test are debugged by hand. I was told that they have no plans to halt manufacture of the older RFM12B modules as long as there is demand.<br /><br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V4wMyZqIQtk/VfhA6uNNyKI/AAAAAAABeAA/F42ios1SfkI/s1600/b_HopeRF_factory.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="640" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-V4wMyZqIQtk/VfhA6uNNyKI/AAAAAAABeAA/F42ios1SfkI/s640/b_HopeRF_factory.jpg" width="640" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;HopeRF factory in Shenzhen where RF modules are designed, manufactured &amp; tested.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br /><br /><br /></em> Travelling via train emits 80-90% less carbon then flying [Source: <a href="http://www.seat61.com/CO2flights.htm">http://www.seat61.com/CO2flights.htm</a>].<br /><br />The international ‘safe’ level of emissions per person is around 2T/yr to contain global temperature changes at or below 2 deg C which will ‘hopefully’ keep runway climate change and subsequent rise in sea levels at bay. Return fight from London to Málaga will emit 2/3T of carbon per person<br /><br />6.5T to Auckland Australia or 2T to New York.

    <id>https://blog.openenergymonitor.org/2015/07/what-is-embodied-energy-of</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Continuing with the <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2015/06/investigating-embodied-energy-of-emonpi.html">investigation into the embodied energy that it takes to make an energy monitor</a>, I thought I would explore in a little more detail the embodied energy of the microcontroller which is often associated with the most energy intensive aspect of electronics manufacture.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Atk61lU9PJg/VZm5VQZtIlI/AAAAAAAATbw/WKqu8g7mhh4/s1600/atmegaemonpi.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Atk61lU9PJg/VZm5VQZtIlI/AAAAAAAATbw/WKqu8g7mhh4/s1600/atmegaemonpi.jpg" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />As I mentioned before I wouldn’t put a large amount of confidence in the accuracy of the figures below, computer chips are incredibly complex things that take a large number of manufacturing processes to make and I have found it hard to find open detailed information on energy requirements of these. The calculations below are based on the datasets that I could find including the EU <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sustainable-business/ecodesign/methodology/index_en.htm">ecodesign dataset</a> which I’m told is one of the higher quality freely available sources. But I could not find much detail on how the figures where derived to know what it does and does not include and the breakdown of energy use in its manufacture.<br /><br />The idea here is more to get an initial set of numbers that could be improved upon in the future. My motivation for looking into this started by being inspired by <a href="http://www.howies.co.uk/">howies</a> and <a href="http://www.patagonia.com/us/footprint">patagonia’s</a> efforts on footprint and supply chain analysis, partly by reading <a href="http://withouthotair.com/c15/page_88.shtml">sustainable energy without the hot air</a> that identifies industry as being a significant part of overall energy use and also after reading the article here about <a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html">‘the monster footprint of digital technology’.</a><br /><br />The following starts by looking at the available datasets and then investigates deriving figures for the embodied energy of a chip by calculation of the actual semiconductor volume contained which compares well for the small IC embodied energy value.<br /><br /><b>1) Datasets</b><br /><br /><b>EU Ecodesign methodology</b><br />The EU ecodesign methodology downloadable here <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/5308/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native">http://ec.europa.eu/DocsRoom/documents/5308/attachments/1/translations/en/renditions/native</a> provides embodied energy values for a variety of electronic component categories, it provides two embodied energy values for IC’s (integrated circuits) these are:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Large IC                        8021.88 MJ/kg</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Small IC                        1786.73 MJ/kg</span><br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">MJ/kg: 1,000,000 Joules per kg </span><br /><br />The question is what constitutes a small or large IC? Dimensions? processing power? and there is a large difference between both of these values!<br /><br />Another paper that lists sources for embodied energy values including the EU ecodesign dataset is this paper on the embodied energy of an offgrid light<a href="http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf">: http://users.humboldt.edu/arne/Alstone_etal_Lumina-TR9-Embodied-Energy_Jan11.pdf</a>. It lists two other useful values:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Semiconductor Grade Si             35000 MJ/kg, Taiariol et al. 2001</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">EPROM Chip (M27C1001, 0.36 W IC)   12.5 MJ/chip,  Taiariol et al. 2001</span><br /><br />Jean Claude Wippler of JeeLabs did an interesting post a couple of years ago on what is inside an ATmega8 chip. The Silicon part was extracted by dissolving the outer casing with sulphuric and nitric acid. <a href="http://jeelabs.org/2013/06/09/whats-inside-that-chip">http://jeelabs.org/2013/06/09/whats-inside-that-chip</a><br /><br />The size of the semiconductor part inside the ATmega8 is 2855 x 2795 um, less than 3x3mm:<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QvJnGzXeRLg/VZmgRUCvqgI/AAAAAAAATbM/Keu1ATBsQ0g/s1600/siliconchip.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="387" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-QvJnGzXeRLg/VZmgRUCvqgI/AAAAAAAATbM/Keu1ATBsQ0g/s400/siliconchip.png" width="400" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />Is it possible to estimate the embodied energy of a microcontroller by working out the embodied energy of the silicon part and the casing part separately? and how would the figure compare with the embodied energy values given for a small and large IC in the EU ecodesign dataset?<br /><br /><b>Thickness</b><br />To find the embodied energy of the silicon part we need to first work out the weight of that part. To do this we will need the density and thickness of the silicon wafer. The thickness of a silicon wafer can be anywhere between 275um and 926um.<br /><br /><b>Density of silicon:</b> 2.3290 g.cm3 https://en.wikipedia.org/?title=Silicon<br /><br /><b>Weight</b><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">2855 x 2795 um x 275 um = 0.00219 cm3 x 2.329 g.m3 = 0.0051 g</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">2855 x 2795 um x 625 um = 0.00499 cm3 x 2.329 g.m3 = 0.0116 g</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">2855 x 2795 um x 926 um = 0.00739 cm3 x 2.329 g.m3 = 0.0172 g</span><br /><br />The embodied energy of silicon grade Si is around 35000 MJ/kg, 35 MJ/g<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">0.0051 g x 35MJ/g = 0.178 MJ = 0.049 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">0.0116 g x 35 MJ/g = 0.406 MJ = 0.113 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">0.0172 g x 35 MJ/g = 0.602 MJ = 0.167 kWh</span><br /><br />The weight of a SMT Atmega 328 is 0.14375g:<br /><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Large IC: 8021.88 MJ/kg = 1.153 MJ = 0.320 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Small IC: 1786.73 MJ/kg = 0.257 MJ = 0.071 kWh</span><br /><br />The EPROM Chip (M27C1001, 0.36 W IC) example is 12.5 MJ/chip = 3.47 kWh<br />Which is between 10 and 50x the large/small IC estimates and 20 to 70x the wafer only estimates.<br /><br />The large IC is between 2x and 6x the wafer only and small IC is between 0.5x to 1.5x the wafer only estimate.<br /><br />The weight of the silicon part of the chip for the ATmega8 should be between 3.5% to 12% of the total chip weight.<br /><br />The rest of the weight is metal and plastic. Copper has an embodied energy of between 38MJ/kg and 142MJ/kg depending on manufacturing process and plastic is anywhere between 80-120MJ/kg. If we assume a copper/plastic mix of around 100MJ/kg as a rough estimate.<br /><br />This would then contribute an additional 0.0132 MJ = 0.0037 kWh which would only increase the embodied energy of the chip by around 2-7%.<br /><br />Our estimate therefore for the embodied energy of the small microcontroller is between 0.053 kWh and 0.171 kWh, mid range of 0.117 kWh for 625um wafer which compares well with the small IC estimate of 0.071 kWh (it is of the right magnitude). We would expect a certain amount of assembly energy for combining the plastic, copper and semiconductor parts which is not included when taking a constituent parts approach which will likely add a little more to the total.<br /><b><br />Package type?</b><br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WazQBqTygXI/VZm3wiRIuFI/AAAAAAAATbk/d2LwHZ6TahA/s1600/packagetype.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="125" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-WazQBqTygXI/VZm3wiRIuFI/AAAAAAAATbk/d2LwHZ6TahA/s400/packagetype.jpg" width="400" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />Calculating the embodied energy this way brings up an important question about the package type of the IC, I.e how much plastic and connector metal surrounds the semiconductor core. If the size of the semiconductor inside a through-hole and SMT version of a ATmega328 is the same then surely a total weight based measure is not a good guide for the embodied energy. Given that over 90% the embodied energy is associated with 3.5 - 12% of the weight.<br /><br /><b>RaspberryPi chips</b><br />The ATmega8 or ATmega328 is not a particularly powerful chip, the emonpi also uses a RaspberryPi which has three chips on board.<br /><br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PdjkOiAbz6U/VZm2iti-xgI/AAAAAAAATbc/MFm6leg9lsI/s1600/Pi2ModB1GB_-comp.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="225" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PdjkOiAbz6U/VZm2iti-xgI/AAAAAAAATbc/MFm6leg9lsI/s400/Pi2ModB1GB_-comp.jpeg" width="400" /></a>&lt;/div&gt;<br />Its not clear what the volumes of the semiconductors inside these chips are. But given their small size and relatively large processing power lets assume for an initial calculation that the size of the package is very close to the size of the semiconductor. If the wafer thickness is 625um then the embodied energy of the chips can be estimated as:<br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;"><br /></span><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Broadcom        14 x 14 mm x 625um = ~2.8 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Elpida          12 x 12 mm x 625um = ~2.0 kWh</span><br /><span style="font-family: &quot;Courier New&quot;,Courier,monospace;">Smst            8.7 x 8.7 mm x 625um = ~1.1 kWh</span><br /><br />These estimates which cover a quad core 900Mhz + 1GB ram computer are much larger than the ATmega8 estimate as we would expect but are still significantly lower than the embodied energy figure given for the 32MB 2g memory chip referenced in the article on the <a href="http://www.lowtechmagazine.com/2009/06/embodied-energy-of-digital-technology.html">the monster footprint of digital technology</a> of 20 kWh - while delivering much more functionality, almost a full computer! <br /><br />Are these figures accurate? are the underlying datasets accurate for modern processors? Does it mean that newer miniaturised technology with the ability to pack much more computing power inside the same volume of semiconductor has resulted in a significant reduction in the embodied energy for equivalent amounts of computing digital technology functionality? These are all significant guesses at the moment and it would be really interesting and useful to see more open data available on the embodied energy of newer technology. It would be good to see greater interest from the manufacturers of these chips in calculating and giving information on the embodied energy of their products, making data available on this would really help with understanding this question about the impact of technology.</p>

<p>In 2011 we got our first emonTx V1 PCB manufactured, <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.com/2011/05/meet-emontx.html">see introduction blog post</a>. Only a few (about 10 in fact) of V1’s were made, we sent most of them out for free to friends and developers. If you have one, it’s a rare piece of hardware! We quickly moved to V2, tweaking a few things. The design did not really change huge amount to the V2.2 design which we’re still selling in the shop.&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HyPl5QiTXbc/UqZFRK_O7LI/AAAAAAAAroU/16R_5EBTY7w/s1600/emonTx_web__82374.1350635241.1280.1280__59330.1350635478.1280.1280.png" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="229" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-HyPl5QiTXbc/UqZFRK_O7LI/AAAAAAAAroU/16R_5EBTY7w/s320/emonTx_web__82374.1350635241.1280.1280__59330.1350635478.1280.1280.png" width="320" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;emonTx V2 - March 2012&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"&gt;The emonTx V2.2 design which has been the backbone of the project for the last year and a half, in that time we’ve sold almost 5000 of these! They have been shipped all over the word from Hawaii to Korea and most places in between! &lt;/div&gt;<br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8beLi3TzsUQ/UqGLA6mt4bI/AAAAAAAAre4/6SKO64ZuMjs/s1600/emonTxSMT_built.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-8beLi3TzsUQ/UqGLA6mt4bI/AAAAAAAAre4/6SKO64ZuMjs/s320/emonTxSMT_built.jpg" width="320" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;emonTx SMT prototype V? - Aug 2012&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In the summer of 2012 we worked on an <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.co.uk/2012/08/emontx-smt-progress-update.html">emonTx SMT prototype</a>, we threw all bells and whistles into this basing the design on an Atmel energy monitoring app note. This design was based on the ATmega32U4 and would be very accurate with adjustable gain pre-amps on the CT channels. However after building a first prototype (which worked!) we realised that the price of this unit would probably be more than most would be willing to part with for an energy monitor. Keeping in mind that a web-connected base station and LCD display would probably also be desired for a full monitoring system. We also realised that for our first intro into SMT manufacture this design with it’s very extensive BOM was perhaps a little ambitious. <br /><br />The first emonTx SMT design was shelved (at least for the time being) and we put our efforts into designing a simpler more streamline <a href="http://openenergymonitor.blogspot.com/2013/02/emontx-smt-update-introducing-emontx-v3.html">unit</a> with <a href="http://openenergymonitor.org/emon/emontx/accuracy">performance on par with the emonTx V2</a> which is good enough for most energy monitoring applications. Here was born the emonTx V3:<br /><br />&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Srt0vZJNYMc/UpJtyoyAo5I/AAAAAAAAqzw/Cw7dSbrAuJ8/s1600/emonTxV3_full_noCase_RFM12B.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><span style="color: black;"><img border="0" height="254" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Srt0vZJNYMc/UpJtyoyAo5I/AAAAAAAAqzw/Cw7dSbrAuJ8/s320/emonTxV3_full_noCase_RFM12B.JPG" width="320" /></span></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;<span style="font-size: small;">emonTx V3 - Dec 2013</span>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The emonTx V3 was designed to be easily SMT manufactured, fit nicely into a tidy wall mountable enclosure, be flexible in terms of RF and MCU and have some useful additional features such as the ability to power the unit from a single AC power adapter which also provides an AC signal for Real Power and Irms calculations.<br />&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LEDZPPoHpOo/UqZIvO3YslI/AAAAAAAAro8/LGGuq6FjL5E/s1600/IMG_20131128_161339.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-LEDZPPoHpOo/UqZIvO3YslI/AAAAAAAAro8/LGGuq6FjL5E/s320/IMG_20131128_161339.jpg" width="320" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;emonTx V3 SMT pre-assembled&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vsrrj5f0TO4/UqZH3Kq3s_I/AAAAAAAArow/lQryYSliiUk/s1600/emonTx_V3_assembled.JPG" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="152" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-vsrrj5f0TO4/UqZH3Kq3s_I/AAAAAAAArow/lQryYSliiUk/s320/emonTx_V3_assembled.JPG" width="320" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;The finished emonTx V3 unit&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;table align="center" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="tr-caption-container" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style="text-align: center;"&gt;<a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GUMsEiD8-Zw/UqZSfx8JRhI/AAAAAAAArpU/RrmagzF9aQw/s1600/20131129_150633_Ffordd+Y+Parc.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-GUMsEiD8-Zw/UqZSfx8JRhI/AAAAAAAArpU/RrmagzF9aQw/s320/20131129_150633_Ffordd+Y+Parc.jpg" width="320" /></a>&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td class="tr-caption" style="text-align: center;"&gt;Feeling like a proud parent as the first emonTx V3 is shipped…while also rocking a <a href="https://www.movember.com/">Movember</a>!&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We’re proud of where we have got to, however (as always!) there is still much work to do. Hardware wise we plan to make the emonGLCD pre-assembled SMT and (hopefully) reduce its cost in 2014 and also dip our toes into control of appliances as well as making system setup as easy as possible. &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;<br />&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thanks for your continued support along this journey. We would not have achieved half as has much if we were not standing on the shoulders of many other open-source projects and community contributions. &lt;div&gt;&lt;div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This morning I visited <a href="http://kaizentechnology.co.uk/">Kaizen Technology</a> in Royston near Cambridge. They're manufacturing the <a href="http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/sensor-nodes/">emonTx V3 and emonTx Arduino Shield SMT</a> energy monitoring nodes. We choose Kaizen since we have worked with them before to supply us with components and as far as manufacture goes that have very good capabilities. They are able to perform <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_soldering">wave soldering</a>&nbsp;to automate the soldering of thru-hole components. This keeps the cost down on a board like the emonTx V3 where there are many thru-hole connectors.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><br /></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Since the emonTx Arduino Shield has got thru-hole components which are inserted from the rear of the board this could not be wave soldered. To keep cost down we will be shipping the emonTx Shield with only the SMT components placed and the thru-hole components supplies as a kit. The emonTx V3 will be fully assembled (SMT&nbsp;+ thru-hole), apart from the<a href="http://shop.openenergymonitor.com/microcontrollers/"> RFu328</a>&nbsp;to retain user flexibility as some users might want to use an SRF instead of the RFM12B or even use a different MCU in place of ATmega328.&nbsp;</div>
